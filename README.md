Qt5 library and tools for interacting with Neovim.

## Requirements

* Qt5
* libmsgpack
* Neovim

## Build

You can build using CMake and your build system of choice. It should build in any
system where Qt5 and Msgpack can build. e.g. for Unix run

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

## Design

The NeovimConnector class is used to setup the connection to Neovim. It also
provides you with some VERY low level methods to call RPC functions - but in general
you should be using the QObject returned by NeovimConnector::neovimObject()

1. To call a function just call the corresponding slot - slots 
   have the same names as the original neovim functions - 
   these are async (return void)
2. To get the result of the call catch the corresponding signals,
   by convention these signals are named 'on\_' + slot\_name
3. The Neovim() class is automagically generated from the Neovim
   metadata
5. For Neovim functions that take the **Object** type we use **QVariant**,
   this seems to be the natural equivalent in Qt
6. To catch Neovim Notifications  you can connect to the
   Neovim::neovimNotification signal

## To Update the RPC bindings

Part of the code is autogenerated by calling Neovim to get the API metadata,
and generating C++ code. This is done using a python script
(generate\_bindings.py) if you just want to use neovim-qt as is you don't need
to worry about this, I already include the generated code in the repository.

The bindings source templates are stored under the bindings/ folder the 
generated code is in src/auto/.

To generate the bindings yourself you need

- python
- python-msgpack
- jinja2

Just run `make bindings`.
